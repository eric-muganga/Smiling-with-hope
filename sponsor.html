                    <h2>What is sponsorship?</h2>
                    <p>When you sponsor a child, you care for and encourage them through prayer, letter writing and financial support. That support empowers a local church to individually and holistically meet their needs in a loving, safe community where they can learn, grow, play and dream.</p>

                                <p>When you become a sponsor, you are personally connected with a child who will know your name and treasure the thought that you care about them.</p>

                    So right now he is staying with the dad who is a typical drunkard and very old.
                    Despite the fact that his body is too weak,he digs people's gardens in order to survive.
                    But the money he gets is very little to sustain his family of 16 people and providing all their basic needs.
                    According to Edward's way of living, our humble prayer is that God provides him with a sponsor to help him with Basic needs and education.</p>

                    The father is bed ridden in the hospital due to cancer for almost 2yrs now.
                    His mother digs people's gardens in order to earn a living.But the little money she gets is too little to cater for her family because most of it goes to the hospital to treat the sick husband.
                    The children therefore are unable to get education and the basic necessities of life 
                    So any assistance rendered to Faizali will be of great value to brighten his future.
